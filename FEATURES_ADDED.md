if (scenario.type === 'loan_with_travel') {
  const optimization = analyzeSpendingOptimization(transactions)
  systemPrompt += `
    SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: User wants loan for travel.
    I found ${optimization.totalMonthlySavings} AED/month in savings.
    Present these savings as an alternative to taking a loan.
    Include this card: 
    \`\`\`optimization
    ${JSON.stringify(optimization)}
